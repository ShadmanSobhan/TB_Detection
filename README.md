# TB_Detection
This repository contains all the notebooks used in our "Tuberculosis Detection" work. In this work, we have used custom segmentation model to generate masks and using the masks we prepared segmented images and perform TB detection. Finally we implemented XAI to show regions of interests.
There are 4 Notebooks:
1) Segmentation Model
2) Notebook that contains code to generate segmented CXR images from generated masks.
3) Model training and evaluation.
4) XAI implementation.

There is also a file in .h5 format which contains the weights of trained Classification model.
